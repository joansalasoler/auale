summary: Play Oware Mancala against the computer
description: |
  Oware is a strategy board game of the Mancala family.

  The goal of Oware is to capture the greatest amount of seeds as possible. To
  do so, players make moves in alternate turns until one of them has captured
  more than 24 seeds. The player who captured more seeds than the opponent when
  the game ends wins the match.

  Play against one of the strongest computer players out there, watch it play
  alone while you learn or choose one of the provided strengths: easy, medium,
  hard or expert.

  Analyze, record, tag and share your own Mancala games. Aual√© can save your
  Oware matches in a portable and human-readable format.

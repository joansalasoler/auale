  What is it?
  -----------

  Aualé - Play oware abapa against the computer or annotate your games
  
  Aualé is a graphical user interface for the popular Oware Abapa board
  game. It may be used to analyze, record and share your own mancala
  games or to play against the computer.

  This interface communicates with an oware engine through an adapted
  version of the Universal Chess Interface protocol, which makes it
  suitable for use with multiple mancala playing programs. Although,
  currently only the Aalina game engine supports this protocol.

  Some of its main features include:

   * Play against the computer or watch how it plays.
   * Easily configurable computer strength.
   * Annotate your matches with an easy to use interface.
   * Save your games using a portable format which resembles that of
     the popular Portable Game Notation format.
